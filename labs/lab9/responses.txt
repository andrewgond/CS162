• Which function are you going to make virtual?
The functions I will make virtual are print_info() and gas_price() within the 
vehicle class. This way each child object needs to calculate the price in its own
way.

• How will you make it polymorphic?
It will be polymorphic because of how they are all children of the 
vehicle class and how they can be pointed to by a vehicle pointer. 

• Can it be a pure virtual function?
The functions that can be pure virtual functions are print_info and gas_price. 

• Which class have you made an abstract base class?
The class I will make as an astract base class will be the vehicle class because
its the parent and it needs certain things to be defined when an object type is called.

• Do any of the destructors need to be virtual? If so, which one(s)
They need to be virtual that way anything in the child classes that was created can be deleted.

• What is the size and capacity of the vector? How to check them?
The size of the vector is 10, and the capacity is 16. We can check through the 
size and capacity funcitons that vectors have. 
• Does your program have any memory leaks? Do you need to manually free the
memory? Why or why not? 
My program does not have memory leaks after deleting every individual one.
