1. Run the program with GDB and/or valgrind, which line in which file generates the segmentation fault?

The line that generated the segementatio fault is at line 27 of main.cpp, in the functions of 
ex1 of populate_garage and populate_car at lines 15 and 24.

2. Use GDB commands that you learned from the previous lab to debug the program. What is the
cause of this segmentation fault? What GDB commands did you use to find it? (Hint: all gdb
commands you typed will be saved in .gdb_history file)

The GDB commands I used to find this were: run, bt, break, next, and print. BT was particullarly helpful
because it showed where exactly the segementation fault was happening and because of that I could find 
which varaibles were getting mixed up 

3. How did you fix the segmentation error?
    I fixed the segmentation error by first properly defining the C* array in the garrage obeject,
and then I found the indexing error on line 15 of the ex1.cpp and finished that.


4. In GDB, what command did you use to verify that the Garage g object stores all information
from the file.txt? Is there another error that needs to be fixed? 
    The command that I could use to verify that Garage g object stored all the information was
    with the print function before everything got deleted so i could check the individual varaibles
    and see that the cars were filled.
